                    <p>A mediation is a safe, confidential and non-disciplinary way to resolve conflict between
                        students. The mediators are trained to help students resolve the problems they may be
                        experiencing with each other, no matter how big or how small by taking them through a carefully
                        structured four stage process. As mediators they do not solve the problem for students but
                        rather help them find a way to solve it themselves. In this way it is empowering for students
                        who often learn new strategies for resolving future conflicts just by participating in a
                        mediation. Participation is voluntary for both parties and the mediation will not take place
                        unless both parties consent to it.</p>
                    <p>Mediation at Onslow is in its thirteenth year and is still going strong. It is a very important
                        way of supporting students and providing them with an independent means of working out their
                        difficulties with other students.</p>

                <div class="right">
                    <p>The Peer Mediation Team at Onslow is comprised of 20 students ranging from Years 10 – 13. They
                        are selected by the incumbent membership at the end of each year. Their training of the
                        mediation process takes place during a three-day camp which is off campus. It also provides a
                        valuable opportunity for members to get to know each other as during a mediation a less
                        experienced mediator will always be paired up with someone more experienced and of the opposite
                        gender. This is to facilitate an even-handed approach.</p>
                    <p>Mediators learn many skills which are valued by prospective employers. They also grow in
                        awareness and confidence over their 2-4-year tenure on the team. It is considered a valuable
                        leadership role but the motivation for most students signing up is not what they can get out of
                        it but rather what they can bring to the role. They must have an interest in helping people and
                        be competent communicators.</p>
